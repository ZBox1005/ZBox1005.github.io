<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I’m a M.S. student at [Sensing IntelliGence and MAchine learning(SIGMA) Lab](http://sigma.whu.edu.cn/) in [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/), under the supervision of [Prof. Zengmao Wang](https://jszy.whu.edu.cn/wangzengmao/zh_CN/more/1231604/jsjjgd/index.htm) and [Prof. Bo Du](https://cs.whu.edu.cn/info/1019/2892.htm). Currently, I am a Research Intern in the Department of [Computer Science](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/) at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/), under the supervision of [Prof. Ruqi Zhang](https://ruqizhang.github.io/). Before that, I was a Research Intern at [TMLR Group](https://github.com/tmlr-group), [Hong Kong Baptist University](https://www.hkbu.edu.hk/en/index.html), fortunately working with [Prof. Bo Han](https://bhanml.github.io/) and [Jianing Zhu](https://zfancy.github.io/).

**Research Interests:** <br>
My primary research objective is to build a reliable and efficient AI model. <br>
My research interests include **trustworthy machine learning**, particularly in *reliability* and its applications to boost the **safety** of foundation models. 
Besides, I am also experienced in other fields of machine learning, including **incremental learning** and **active learning**, and their application to **computer vision**. <br>
If you are intereted in these areas or my previous works, feel free to reach out! I am always delighted for potential collaborations!

- TL;DR: Propose a novel perspective to employ different common corruptions on the input space to expand the representation dimension for OOD detection. With the expectation among multiple input dimension, our method performs a better ID-OOD separability.
